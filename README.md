# well_log_os

`well_log_os` is an open-source Python toolkit for building printable and interactive well-log layouts from LAS and DLIS data.

The project is intentionally renderer-first:
- normalize subsurface data into typed channels
- describe the sheet using templates and layout specs
- render the same document to static and interactive backends

## Status

This repository currently contains the initial scaffold:
- normalized data objects for scalar, array, and raster channels
- a printable log document model with tracks, styles, headers, and footers
- YAML template loading
- a physical page layout engine
- optional `matplotlib` and `plotly` renderer backends
- optional LAS and DLIS ingestion adapters

## Architecture

The package separates three layers:
- `WellDataset`: data and metadata normalized from LAS/DLIS inputs
- `LogDocument`: page, depth, track, and annotation specifications
- renderers: backend-specific drawing implementations that consume the same document

Image tracks are first-class objects. They can host raster data and scalar curve overlays, but curve tracks do not accept raster elements.
Set `page.continuous: true` in templates to render a single continuous-depth PDF page.
Set `page.track_header_height_mm` to reserve a dedicated per-track header band.
Track headers now support explicit object slots (`title`, `scale`, `legend`) with `enabled`,
`reserve_space`, and `line_units` controls to prevent overlap while keeping fixed spacing.
Depth grid density in continuous mode is controlled by `depth.major_step` and `depth.minor_step`.
Use top-level `markers` and `zones` sections to draw formation and event annotations.

## Development Workflow

This project uses `uv` for environment management and dependency resolution.
The package continues to support Python `>=3.11`.
CI validates the project on Python `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`, and `3.14`.

Create or update the environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

Install with optional LAS ingestion and PDF output:

```bash
uv sync --extra las --extra pdf --extra units
```

With all optional backends:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Run tests:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Format and lint:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
```

## Example Template

See [examples/triple_combo.yaml](examples/triple_combo.yaml).

## Real Data Demo

Use the master loader (single command for any log-file YAML):

```bash
uv run python -m well_log_os.cli render examples/cbl_main.log.yaml
```

Validate a log-file against the JSON Schema before rendering:

```bash
uv run python -m well_log_os.cli validate examples/cbl_main.log.yaml
```

Optional output override:

```bash
uv run python -m well_log_os.cli render examples/cbl_main.log.yaml -o out.pdf
```

Convenience wrapper:

```bash
uv run examples/real_data_demo.py
```

Or pass a specific log file:

```bash
uv run examples/real_data_demo.py examples/cbl_main.log.yaml
```

Use [examples/cbl_main.log.yaml](examples/cbl_main.log.yaml) as the base file your future UI can load/save.
Each track in that file has its own `configure` section under `auto_tracks.tracks`.
Keep local input/output assets under:
- `workspace/data/` for LAS/DLIS
- `workspace/renders/` for generated PDF/HTML/JSON outputs
The entire `workspace/` folder is excluded from git.
Note: LAS ingestion is implemented; DLIS normalization is still scaffolded.
