# well_log_os Decision Log

Last updated: 2026-03-18

## Purpose

This file records project decisions that should remain stable unless explicitly revised.

## Product and Scope Decisions

- Language: Python only.
- Primary objective: display/render quality over ingestion complexity.
- Outputs: both static printable output and interactive viewing.
- Growth path: start as a Python library, then extend to web apps.
- Domain focus: wireline logs, including triple-combo, image/raster logs, and petrophysical outputs.

## Architecture Decisions

- Renderer-first architecture with three layers:
  - `WellDataset` for normalized data
  - `LogDocument` for layout and visualization specs
  - renderer backends for output generation
- Templates are YAML-driven and define page geometry, depth behavior, tracks, and annotations.
- The next public API phase should keep YAML as serialization while promoting the in-memory model
  to the canonical authoring surface for Python users.

## Data Model Decisions

- Image tracks are first-class tracks.
- Raster/image data must not be forced into curve tracks.
- Curve tracks reject raster elements.
- Curves can overlay inside image tracks.
- Log configurations are persisted in a dedicated YAML "log-file" spec (not hardcoded in scripts).
- Track layouts are configured first in YAML (`document.layout.log_sections[*].tracks`),
  then channels are assigned via `document.bindings.channels`.
- Rendering is executed through a master log-file pipeline/CLI, not per-file loaders.
- Log-file YAML is validated with a JSON Schema before parsing/building.
- CLI includes a dedicated `validate` command for logfile preflight checks.
- Log-file configs support YAML template inheritance (`template.path`) plus savefile overrides.
- Data-source ownership is section-first:
  - preferred source location is `document.layout.log_sections[*].data`
  - top-level `data` is optional default/fallback
- Track header data is modeled as typed objects (`title`, `scale`, `legend`), not ad-hoc text.
- Track header objects support:
  - `enabled` to show/hide content
  - `reserve_space` to preserve layout slot when hidden
  - `line_units` to control relative vertical allocation
- Raster sample axes may be auto-derived from source metadata, but must remain user-overridable in
  logfile YAML for vendor-parity tuning.
- Curve fills are first-class curve-owned objects, not ad-hoc renderer flags.
- Instance-targeted fills identify rendered curve instances by `id` / `other_element_id`, not by
  aliasing or duplicate channel names.
- Reference-track scalar overlays are first-class curve display modes (`curve`, `indicator`,
  `ticks`), not accidental reuse of generic x-axis behavior.
- Reference-track local events are track-owned layout objects under `reference.events`, not channel
  bindings and not global document markers.
- Annotation tracks own typed layout objects (`interval`, `text`, `marker`, `arrow`, `glyph`)
  instead of channel bindings.
- Annotation-track annotations may occupy normalized sub-lanes inside the track through
  `lane_start` / `lane_end`.
- Report heading and tail share one report object:
  - `heading` is the full cover/detail page
  - `tail` is a compact summary view of the same data
  - `tail` is enabled by layout toggle, not by duplicating another report model
- Page-level notes under the heading use `layout.remarks`, not a generic comments bucket.
- Report detail tables are fixed-row, fixed-column structures:
  - one selected detail kind per report (`open_hole` or `cased_hole`)
  - empty cells stay empty and rows do not collapse
  - row-local splits are expressed with `label_cells` and `columns[].cells`
- Programmatic ingestion of computed data should target validated internal channel objects, not raw
  YAML-shaped dicts:
  - scalar results enter as typed scalar channels with explicit index and units
  - array/raster results enter as typed array channels with explicit index, sample axis, and units
  - shared index alignment is not assumed; each channel must carry its own valid basis
- The public Python API should be split into four areas:
  - dataset ingestion
  - document building
  - rendering
  - serialization
- Delivery order was adjusted after the first notebook ingestion demo:
  - dataset ingestion came first
  - the in-memory composition/render bridge moved ahead of pandas adapters
  - reason: notebook workflows are not useful until in-memory datasets can use the actual log
    layout renderer instead of ad-hoc plotting

## Rendering Decisions

- Continuous log-strip mode is supported (`page.continuous: true`) for single long-page PDFs.
- Track header band has dedicated physical space (`page.track_header_height_mm`).
- Depth grid cadence is template-controlled (`depth.major_step`, `depth.minor_step`).
- Markers and zones are top-level annotation objects.
- Header slot geometry is reserved to prevent overlaps.
- Array rendering profiles are explicit:
  - `vdl` for density-style Variable Density Log display
  - `waveform` for wiggle/signature-style display without mandatory raster background
- Selected array sample-axis windows crop the underlying data to the requested interval; they do
  not relabel the full stored waveform width.
- Curve fill semantics are data-space semantics:
  - `to_lower_limit` / `to_upper_limit` refer to active scale bounds, not fixed screen sides
  - `baseline_split` is resolved against a data-value baseline
- Track headers may render preview indicators for the actual fill semantics shown in the track body.
- Curve callouts are curve-owned display objects.
- Repeated callouts from `top`, `bottom`, and `top_and_bottom` are generated relative to the full
  log section bounds and rendered inline at those generated depths.
- Reference-track headers keep their own scale/unit row and use the legend slot for overlay
  properties when legends are enabled.
- Curve-header label wrapping is opt-in per curve through `header_display.wrap_name`; the default
  remains truncation to keep existing header layouts stable.
- Annotation tracks reuse the generic per-track grid system; grid suppression is configured through
  the same `tracks[*].grid.horizontal` / `tracks[*].grid.vertical` blocks used elsewhere.
- Annotation tracks support bounded interval blocks, free-form text boxes, marker symbols, arrow
  objects, and glyph objects.
- Dense annotation tracks may reserve dedicated event-label sub-lanes through
  `label_mode: dedicated_lane` plus `label_lane_start` / `label_lane_end` instead of relying only
  on free-placement heuristics.
- Report service titles are first-class styled objects, not renderer-only strings:
  - `font_size`
  - `auto_adjust`
  - `bold`
  - `italic`
  - `alignment`
  - the same title formatting applies to both the heading and the tail
- Remarks blocks are rendered as first-page report sections and accept simple structured text:
  - `title`
  - `text` or `lines`
  - alignment and font sizing
  - optional local background/border styling

## Tooling and Process Decisions

- Dependency and environment management: `uv`.
- Formatting and linting: `ruff`.
- Tests: `unittest` executed through `uv run`.
- License: Apache-2.0.
- Optional dependencies:
  - LAS: `lasio`, `welly`
  - DLIS: `dlisio`
  - static PDF rendering: `matplotlib`
  - interactive rendering: `plotly`

## Python Compatibility Decision

- Package metadata currently states Python `>=3.11`.
- CI validates 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.

## Revision Rule

When a decision changes, update this file with:

- previous decision
- new decision
- effective date
- rationale
